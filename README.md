# CppFallingBoxes
This Repo is made to study Box 2D, attempting to integrate it with SFML.

I did not give much thought into the architecture of the project, hence the bloated main.cpp and Entity class.

If this was a bigger project, i would consider segregating classes via components or do some kind of polymorphism to decouple better.
